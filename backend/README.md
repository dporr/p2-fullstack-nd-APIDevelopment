# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## General environment configutations
This project makes use of environment variables in order to store sensitive data, ensure you run each command adding an empty space at the begining, before the ```export``` and avoid spaces arround equal sign, this way we avoid storing plaintext secrets on shell history file.
```bash
export POSTGRES_USER=[your db username]
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[your z00per secret password string]
export POSTGRES_HOST=[the FQDN or IP you database server uses]
export APP_DATABASE=[The database schema you will use]
```
## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

### Setting up database container
First you will need to create a folder that will act as persistent volume for your postgres container
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres
```
Then spin up the docker container. the -p setting indicates the port where your DB will be exposed, this should be consistent with the one you include in the app config. (read docker documentation for additional info)
```bash
sudo docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data  postgres
```
### Populating the database
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

## Avaible Endpoints

In order to play the game, a number of operations take place, each one of them belong to a specific endpoint. The available operations are:

- [GET categories](#getCategories)
- [GET questions](#getQuestions1)
- [GET questions (for a specific category)](#getQuestions2)
- [DELETE question](#deleteQuestion)
- [POST question (create question)](#createQuestion)
- [POST question (search question)](#postQuestion)
- [POST quizzes (to play game)](#postQuizzes)
